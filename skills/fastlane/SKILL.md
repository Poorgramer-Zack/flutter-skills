# Flutter combined with Fastlane Best Practices (CI/CD - Deployment)

## Goal
Implements Fastlane for iOS/Android building, code signing, and deployment. [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is an open-source Ruby script toolset. Although it is not a cloud CI platform (like GitHub Actions), it can **run on top of any CI platform**. It is widely recognized as the ultimate tool for handling the tedious compilation, certification, and submission processes for iOS/Android.

## Instructions

### 1. Separation of Responsibilities
In Flutter development, the best way to combine tools is:
*   **Flutter CLI (`flutter build`)**: Responsible for compiling Dart code into native iOS projects or Android Bundles (AAB).
*   **Fastlane (`fastlane gym/supply/deliver`)**: Takes over subsequent Xcode/Gradle building, handling complex "Code Signing" and pushing to stores (TestFlight / Google Play Console).

### 2. Solving iOS Certificate Pain Points: `fastlane match` (⭐️ Absolutely Essential)
The most painful part of iOS development is syncing `Certificates` and `Provisioning Profiles` when a new team member joins.

`fastlane match` solution: **Encrypt all certificates and centrally manage them in a private Git Repo.**

#### 2.1 Environment Setup & Usage
1. Create a Private GitHub Repository (e.g., `ios-certificates`).
2. Run `fastlane match init` in the terminal to align with the repository URL.
3. Run `fastlane match appstore`, which will automatically connect to the Apple Server, revoke unused certificates, generate brand new ones, and **encrypt and push them to the Git Repo.**

#### 2.2 Match in the CI Environment
On any fresh CI machine, you only need one lane in your Fastfile:
```ruby
lane :beta do
  # 🌟 The machine instantly automatically downloads, decrypts, and installs all certificates!
  match(type: "appstore", readonly: is_ci) 
  
  # Start building
  gym(workspace: "Runner.xcworkspace", scheme: "Runner") 
end
```

### 3. Auto-Incrementing Version Numbers
App Store requires that the Build Number (e.g., the `123` in `1.0.0+123`) increments with every upload.

**Best Practice**: Do not update this manually. Let Fastlane fetch the latest number from the store and increment it.

#### 3.1 Android Incrementing
Use plugins, directly read/write `pubspec.yaml`, or use Fastlane's native API:
```ruby
lane :release_android do
  # Fetch the current latest version number from Google Play
  play_track_version = google_play_track_version_codes(
    package_name: "com.example.app",
    track: "production"
  )[0]
  
  new_build_number = play_track_version + 1
  # Combine with a script to write back to pubspec.yaml or gradle
end
```

#### 3.2 iOS Incrementing
iOS has an excellent built-in action:
```ruby
lane :release_ios do
  # 🌟 Automatically fetch the latest number from App Store Connect and add 1
  increment_build_number(
    build_number: latest_testflight_build_number + 1 
  )
end
```

### 4. Push to Store (Play Store & App Store)
Once the Fastfile is configured, your deployment process is simplified to a single command.

#### 4.1 Push Android to Google Play Console
Requires setting up a `Google Play Service Account JSON` key.

```ruby
# android/fastlane/Fastfile
lane :deploy_beta do
  # 1. (Done externally) run flutter build appbundle --release
  
  # 2. Automatically upload to internal testing track
  upload_to_play_store(
    track: 'internal',
    aab: '../build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab',
    json_key: ENV['PLAY_STORE_JSON_KEY_PATH'] # 🌟 CI Variable
  )
end
```

#### 4.2 Push iOS to TestFlight
Requires setting up an `App Store Connect API Key`.

```ruby
# ios/fastlane/Fastfile
lane :deploy_testflight do
  # 1. Fetch API Key (Replaces traditional two-factor auth Apple accounts)
  app_store_connect_api_key(
    key_id: ENV['ASC_KEY_ID'],
    issuer_id: ENV['ASC_ISSUER_ID'],
    key_filepath: ENV['ASC_KEY_PATH']
  )

  # 2. Pull certificates
  match(type: "appstore")

  # 3. Build IPA in Xcode
  gym(workspace: "Runner.xcworkspace", scheme: "Runner")

  # 4. 🌟 Upload to TestFlight and automatically email testers
  upload_to_testflight(
    skip_waiting_for_build_processing: true
  )
end
```

## Constraints
*   Ensure that the Fastlane scripts are kept within the repository.
*   Once setup, CI simply calls `bundle exec fastlane deploy_testflight` to achieve full deployment automation.
