# Flutter Environment Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## Goal
Establish a reliable, optimized Flutter development environment across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. This guide covers initial SDK installation, PATH configuration, IDE setup, and comprehensive troubleshooting for common setup issues, dependency conflicts, and tooling misconfigurations.

## Prerequisites Checklist
Before starting Flutter installation, verify:
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 2.8 GB for SDK, plus additional space for IDEs and Android SDK
- **Network Access**: Stable internet connection for downloading SDK and dependencies
- **Administrative Access**: Ability to modify system PATH and install software
- **Git Installed**: Required for Flutter SDK management and updates

---

## 🚀 Installation Process

### Step 1: Download and Extract Flutter SDK
1. Download the latest stable Flutter SDK from flutter.dev for your platform
2. Extract to a permanent location (avoid temporary directories)
3. **Important**: Choose paths without spaces or special characters

**Recommended Installation Paths:**
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/development/flutter` or `/opt/flutter`
- **Windows**: `C:\develop\flutter` (NEVER use `C:\Program Files\`)

### Step 2: Configure PATH Environment Variable

#### Linux/macOS PATH Configuration
Add Flutter to your shell configuration file:

**For Bash** (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/.pub-cache/bin"
```

**For Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```zsh
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/.pub-cache/bin"
```

**For Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```fish
set -gx PATH $PATH $HOME/development/flutter/bin
set -gx PATH $PATH $HOME/development/flutter/.pub-cache/bin
```

**Apply changes immediately:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Windows PATH Configuration

**Method 1: PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
$flutterPath = "C:\develop\flutter\bin"
$currentPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
if ($currentPath -notmatch [regex]::Escape($flutterPath)) {
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$currentPath;$flutterPath", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
}
```

**Method 2: GUI**
1. Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
2. Under "User variables", select `Path` → Edit
3. Click "New" and add `C:\develop\flutter\bin`
4. Click OK and restart terminal

**Important**: Close and reopen all terminal windows after PATH changes.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Run the Flutter doctor command to check installation status:
```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

This command checks for:
- Flutter SDK installation
- Android toolchain (Android SDK, NDK, Platform Tools)
- Chrome (for web development)
- Visual Studio / Xcode (platform-specific)
- Connected devices
- IDE plugins

3. Install Dart extension (auto-installed with Flutter)
4. Restart VS Code

**Recommended VS Code Settings:**
```json
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": "C:\\develop\\flutter",
  "dart.debugExternalPackageLibraries": true,
  "dart.debugSdkLibraries": false,
  "[dart]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.selectionHighlight": false,
    "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false,
    "editor.suggestSelection": "first",
    "editor.tabCompletion": "onlySnippets",
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false
  }
}
```

### Android Studio Setup
1. Download and install Android Studio
2. Open Plugins: `File → Settings → Plugins` (Windows/Linux) or `Android Studio → Preferences → Plugins` (macOS)
3. Search for "Flutter" and install
4. Search for "Dart" and install
5. Restart Android Studio
6. Configure Android SDK: `Tools → SDK Manager`
   - Install latest Android SDK Platform
   - Install Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Install Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Install Android Emulator

### IntelliJ IDEA Setup

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "flutter: command not found"
**Cause**: Flutter bin directory not in system PATH

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Flutter installation path exists
2. Re-add to PATH using platform-specific instructions above
3. Restart terminal/IDE completely
4. Check PATH with: `echo $PATH` (Linux/macOS) or `echo $env:Path` (PowerShell)
5. Ensure no typos in path (check forward/backward slashes)

### Issue 2: "cmdline-tools component is missing"
**Cause**: Android SDK Command-line Tools not installed

**Solution:**
1. Open Android Studio
2. Navigate to `Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Tools`
3. Check "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)"
4. Click "Apply" and wait for installation
5. Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` and accept all

### Issue 3: Android License Status Unknown
**Cause**: Android SDK licenses not accepted

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
Press `y` to accept each license. If this fails:
1. Ensure Android SDK Command-line Tools installed
2. Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk`
   - **Windows**: `setx ANDROID_HOME "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"`
3. Retry license acceptance

### Issue 4: Visual Studio Not Found (Windows)
**Cause**: Visual Studio not installed or missing C++ workload

**Solution:**
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community edition works)
2. During installation, select "Desktop development with C++"
3. Include these individual components:
   - MSVC v142+ build tools
   - Windows 10/11 SDK
   - C++ CMake tools
4. Run `flutter doctor` to verify

### Issue 5: Xcode Not Configured (macOS)
**Cause**: Xcode not installed or command-line tools not configured

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Xcode from Mac App Store, then:
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Issue 6: CocoaPods Not Installed (macOS)
**Cause**: CocoaPods required for iOS plugin dependencies

**Solution:**
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

If gem installation fails, use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install cocoapods
```

### Issue 7: "Unable to find git in your PATH"
**Cause**: Git not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install git`
- **macOS**: `brew install git` or install Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Windows**: Download from git-scm.com and ensure "Git from command line" option selected

### Issue 8: Network/Proxy Issues
**Cause**: Corporate proxy or firewall blocking Flutter downloads

**Solution:**
Configure Flutter to use proxy:
```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1

flutter config --no-analytics  # Disable analytics if blocked
```

For persistent configuration, add to shell profile.

### Issue 9: Multiple Flutter Versions Conflict
**Cause**: Multiple Flutter installations or conflicting PATH entries

**Solution:**
1. Check which Flutter is active: `which flutter` (Linux/macOS) or `where flutter` (Windows)
2. Remove duplicate PATH entries
3. Uninstall unused Flutter installations
4. Clear Flutter cache: `flutter clean` in project directories

### Issue 10: IDE Plugin Not Detecting Flutter SDK
**Cause**: IDE cannot locate Flutter SDK

**Solution:**
1. **VS Code**: Add to settings.json:
   ```json
   {"dart.flutterSdkPath": "/path/to/flutter"}
   ```
2. **Android Studio/IntelliJ**: `Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Flutter → Flutter SDK path`
3. Verify path points to SDK root (contains `bin/`, `packages/`, etc.)

### Issue 11: Hot Reload Not Working
**Cause**: IDE not properly connected or outdated Flutter version

**Solution:**
1. Ensure app running in debug mode (not release)
2. Check IDE console for connection errors
3. Restart app with `r` in terminal or IDE restart button
4. Update Flutter: `flutter upgrade`
5. Clear build cache: `flutter clean`

### Issue 12: Build Failed - Gradle Issues (Android)
**Cause**: Gradle configuration or network issues

**Solution:**
1. Update Gradle wrapper: Edit `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
2. Clear Gradle cache:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   ```
3. Check `android/app/build.gradle` for correct `compileSdkVersion` and `minSdkVersion`

---

## ✅ Post-Installation Verification

After resolving all `flutter doctor` issues:

1. **Create test project:**
   ```bash
   flutter create test_app
   cd test_app
   ```

2. **Run on available device:**
   ```bash
   flutter devices  # List available devices
   flutter run      # Run on default device
   ```

3. **Test hot reload:** Make a change to `lib/main.dart` and press `r` in terminal

4. **Build release version:**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk        # Android
   flutter build ios        # iOS (macOS only)
   flutter build windows    # Windows desktop
   flutter build macos      # macOS desktop
   flutter build linux      # Linux desktop
   ```
