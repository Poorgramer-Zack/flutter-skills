# Flutter Hooks Latest Version Best Practices Guide (v0.21.x)

## Goal
`flutter_hooks` is a package developed by Remi Rousselet (author of Riverpod and Freezed). Its core philosophy stems from React Hooks. The current latest version is **0.21.3+1**.

Hooks primarily exist to solve the verbose boilerplate code brought about by `StatefulWidget`, and the extreme difficulty of reusing UI Logic across Widgets.

## Instructions

### 1. Core Concept: What are Hooks?
Hooks are tools used to manage "**local and ephemeral UI state or side effects**".
*   **Not Suitable For**: Global business logic management (this should be handed over to Riverpod or Bloc).
*   **Suitable For**: Any Widget attaching a `Controller`, animation management, focus tracking, or countdown timers.

#### Dependency Installation
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.21.3
  hooks_riverpod: ^3.3.0 # If you are simultaneously using Riverpod
```

### 2. Widget Declaration: Replacing StatefulWidget
To use Hooks, your Widget cannot inherit from a standard `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget`; it must instead inherit from `HookWidget`.
*(If you are mixing it with Riverpod, inherit from `HookConsumerWidget` instead)*.

All Hooks **are only allowed to be called at the top level inside the `build` method**. Writing them inside `if` statements is strictly prohibited.

### 3. Built-in Hooks Overview and Best Practices
`flutter_hooks` provides a massive number of practical built-in Hooks. Leveraging them effectively can save hundreds of lines of `dispose()` and `initState()`.

#### 3.1 State and Caching (State & Caching)
*   **`useState(initialData)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Manages the simplest local state (essentially wraps `ValueNotifier`).
    *   **Usage**: `final counter = useState(0); counter.value++;`
*   **`useMemoized(compute, [keys])`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Caches the result of an expensive computation, or ensures an object (e.g., a custom class) is instantiated only once during Rebuilds.
    *   **Usage**: `final complexObj = useMemoized(() => HeavyObject(), []);`
*   **`useCallback(callback, [keys])`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Caches a function reference. If passed to deep Widgets, it prevents triggering unnecessary refreshes because parent Rebuilds generate a new function memory location.
*   **`useRef(initialValue)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Holds a mutable object across Rebuild cycles, and **changing its value does not trigger a UI refresh** (unlike `useState`). Perfect for storing the width of a previous screen, or a Timer instance for subsequent clearing.

#### 3.2 Side Effects and Lifecycle (Side Effects)
*   **`useEffect(effect, [keys])`**:
    *   **Purpose**: The perfect alternative to `initState` and `dispose`. Responsible for subscriptions, timers, and any side effect with a start and end point.
    *   **Usage**:
    ```dart
    useEffect(() {
      print('Equivalent to initState (Triggers only when key changes or upon initialization)');
      return () => print('Equivalent to dispose (Executes before Widget destruction or before effect re-triggers)');
    }, []); // Passing [] ensures it runs only once
    ```
*   **`useIsMounted()`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Following an asynchronous request, ensures the Widget has not yet been destroyed before executing operations like `setState`.
    *   **Usage**: `final isMounted = useIsMounted(); ... if(isMounted()) { ... }`

#### 3.3 Auto-cleaning Controllers (Most Powerful Feature)
Forget writing `controller.dispose()` manually! The following Hooks automatically create and destroy them behind the scenes for you:
*   **`useTextEditingController(text: 'default value')`**
*   **`useAnimationController(duration: ...)`**
*   **`useScrollController()`**
*   **`usePageController()`**
*   **`useTabController(length: 3)`**
*   **`useFocusNode()`**

#### 3.4 Reactive Wrappers (Reactive Streams & Futures)
*   **`useFuture(future)`** / **`useStream(stream)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Minimalist versions of `FutureBuilder` / `StreamBuilder`, returning an `AsyncSnapshot`.
*   **`useListenable(listenable)`** / **`useValueListenable(notifier)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Allows a Widget to listen to traditional ChangeNotifier or ValueNotifier and automatically trigger a rebuild.

### 4. Advanced Practices: Custom Hooks (Custom Hooks)
The greatest power of Hooks lies in **encapsulating and perfectly reusing UI logic**.
If multiple parts in your project need an "obtain current App lifecycle state (AppLifecycleState)", rather than writing a bunch of observers on every page, writing it as a Custom Hook solves it once and for all.

> **Naming Convention**: All custom Hooks MUST begin with `use`.

#### Approach A: Composing Multiple Existing Hooks (Composition - Highly Recommended)
The simplest and most favored approach is directly writing a function that returns a result.

```dart
// Encapsulates a set of "countdown timer" logic
int useCountdown({required int seconds}) {
  final timeLeft = useState(seconds);
  final isMounted = useIsMounted();

  useEffect(() {
    final timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
      if (!isMounted()) {
        timer.cancel();
        return;
      }
      
      if (timeLeft.value > 0) {
        timeLeft.value--;
      } else {
        timer.cancel();
      }
    });
    
    return timer.cancel; // Ensures it definitely gets closed
  }, [seconds]); // Resets the timer when 'seconds' change

  return timeLeft.value;
}

// Used in a Widget like this:
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final count = useCountdown(seconds: 30);
  return Text("Remaining $count seconds");
}
```

#### Approach B: Extending the `Hook` Class Definition (Advanced / Low-level Library Development)
If you need access to a lower-level `BuildContext` or want to intercept Flutter's native `didUpdateContext`, you can create a specific Hook much like crafting a StatefulWidget.

```dart
// This pattern is typically geared towards third-party package developers
int useMyComplexLogic() => use(const _MyComplexHook());

class _MyComplexHook extends Hook<int> {
  const _MyComplexHook();
  @override
  _MyComplexHookState createState() => _MyComplexHookState();
}

class _MyComplexHookState extends HookState<int, _MyComplexHook> {
  int value = 0;
  
  @override
  void initHook() { /* Initialization */ }

  @override
  int build(BuildContext context) => value;

  @override
  void dispose() { /* Resource cleanup */ }
}
```

### 5. Conclusion: Integration with Riverpod (The God-tier Combination)
`flutter_hooks` is not designed to replace BLoC or Riverpod. The optimal modern Flutter development architecture:
*   **Global Business Logic and Shared State** $\rightarrow$ `Riverpod` (`riverpod_generator`)
*   **Complex In-Page UI Control and Animation** $\rightarrow$ `flutter_hooks` (`useAnimationController`, `useTextEditingController`)

By combining the two, your project will practically contain zero `StatefulWidget`s. All Widgets can remain clean, focusing purely on their primary duty (drawing the screen), thereby yielding the highest quality Flutter applications.

## Constraints
* Ensure that you ONLY invoke Hooks at the very top level of a `build` method.
* Make sure `hooks_riverpod` is imported if you're mixing Riverpod Providers with flutter hooks; do not mix `hooks_riverpod` imports concurrently with raw `flutter_riverpod`.
* Do NOT enforce `Controller.dispose()` if implementing hooks like `useAnimationController()`.
