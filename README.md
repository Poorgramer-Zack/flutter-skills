# Flutter Skills 🚀

A comprehensive library of modular AI Skills for Flutter & Dart development, designed for precise, production-ready AI Agent workflows. Each skill provides structured knowledge and expert-level guidance optimized for LLM consumption and human readability.

## 🏗️ Skill Architecture

All skills follow a modular, flat structure for maximum clarity and AI compatibility.

### Directory Structure
```text

```

### Core Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each skill focuses on one technology or framework
2. **LLM-Optimized**: Documents are structured for AI context windows with semantic headings
3. **Production-Ready**: Working code snippets, not placeholders
4. **Version-Aware**: All packages use latest stable versions (as of 2026-03-31)

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

- **Minimalist Approach**: Focus on user experience, not engineering abstractions
- **Modern Best Practices**: Latest stable releases with version documentation
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Dart 3+ features (pattern matching, records, sealed classes)
- **Zero Placeholder Policy**: All code snippets are production-ready

## 🚀 Recent Updates (2026-04-01)

### Fleet Mode Quality Audit — All 36 Skills
- ✅ **36 SKILL.md files** audited and standardized to Agent Skill Best Practices
- ✅ **Gerund naming** enforced (`applying-*`, `managing-*`, `testing-*`)
- ✅ **Third-person descriptions** with trigger keywords for precise AI activation
- ✅ **500-line limit** enforced — `flutter-bloc` (594→147 lines) and `flutter-riverpod` (625→162 lines) split with new `references/` files

### Riverpod 3.0 Full Coverage
- ✅ **Breaking changes**: `==` equality for all state comparisons, fresh Notifier instances on rebuild (resource leak risk), `FamilyNotifier` removed, `Ref` generics removed
- ✅ **Consumer vs ConsumerWidget**: decision table; prefer `Consumer` + `ref.watch().select()` for surgical rebuilds
- ✅ **New APIs**: generic providers, `@Dependencies` scoping, `AsyncValue` sealed + `progress`, weak listeners, `overrideWithBuild`
- ✅ **Mutations (experimental)**: `tsx.get()` pattern, exhaustive 4-state switch (`Idle/Pending/Error/Success`)
- ✅ **Offline Persistence (experimental)**: `riverpod_sqflite`, `persist()` in `build()`, `StorageOptions`

### effective-dart — Dart 3.7–3.10 Features
- ✅ **Dot shorthands** (3.10): `.blue` instead of `Color.blue`, `.all(16)` instead of `EdgeInsets.all(16)`
- ✅ **Null-aware collection elements** (3.8): `[?nullable]` auto-excludes nulls
- ✅ **Wildcard variables** (3.7): non-binding `_`, multiple `_` in same scope
- ✅ **New lints** (3.9): `switch_on_type`, `unnecessary_unawaited`, `@awaitNotRequired`

### openapi-to-dart — Reframed as Manual Implementation Guide
- ✅ Removed code-generation framing; now covers Dio client setup, Equatable vs Freezed decision table, Service/Repository layers, `DioException → ApiError` mapping
